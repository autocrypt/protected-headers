--- abstract

This document describes a common strategy to extend the cryptographic protections provided by PGP/MIME, etc. to protect message headers in addition to message bodies.
In addition to protecting the authenticity and integrity of headers via signatures, it also describes how to preserve the confidentiality of the Subject header.

Introduction
============

E-mail end-to-end security with OpenPGP and S/MIME standards can provide integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and confidentiality to the body of a MIME e-mail message.
However, PGP/MIME ({{RFC3156}}) alone does not protect message headers.
And the structure to protect headers defined in S/MIME 3.1 ({{RFC3851}}) has not seen widespread adoption.

This document defines a scheme, "Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail", which has been adopted by multiple existing e-mail clients in order to extend the cryptographic protections provided by PGP/MIME to also protect the message headers.

This document describes how these protections can be applied to cryptographically signed messages, and also discusses some of the challenges of encrypting many transit-oriented headers.

It offers guidance for encrypting non-transit-oriented headers like Subject, and also offers a means to preserve backwards compatibility so that an encrypted Subject remains available to recipients using software that does not implement support for the Protected Headers scheme.

The document also discusses some of the compatibility constraints and usability concerns which motivated the design of the scheme, as well as limitations and a comparison with other proposals.

While the document (and the authors') focus is primarily PGP/MIME, we believe the technique is broadly applicable and would also apply to other MIME-compatible cryptographic e-mail systems, including S/MIME ({{RFC8551}}).  Furthermore, this technique has already proven itself as a useful building block for other improvements to cryptographic e-mail, such as the Autocrypt Level 1.1 ({{Autocrypt}}) "Gossip" mechanism.


Requirements Language
---------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


Terminology
-----------

For the purposes of this document, we define the following concepts:

   * *MUA* is short for Mail User Agent; an e-mail client.
   * *Protection* of message data refers to cryptographic encryption and/or signatures, providing confidentiality, authenticity or both.
   * *Cryptographic Layer*, *Cryptographic Envelope* and * *Cryptographic Payload* are defined in {{cryptographic-structure}}
   * *Original Headers* are the {{RFC2822}} message headers as known to the sending MUA at the time of message composition.
   * *Protected Headers* are any headers protected by the scheme described in this document.
   * *Exposed Headers* are any headers outside the Cryptographic Payload (protected or not).
   * *Obscured Headers* are any Protected Headers which have been modified or removed from the set of Exposed Headers.
   * *Legacy Display Part* is a MIME construct which guarantees visibility of data from the Original Headers which may have been removed or obscured from the Unprotected Headers.

Cryptographic MIME Message Structure {#cryptographic-structure}
====================================

Implementations use the structure of an e-mail message to protect the headers.
This section establishes some conventions about how to think about message structure.

Cryptographic Layers {#cryptographic-layer}
--------------------

"Cryptographic Layer" refers to a MIME substructure that supplies some cryptographic protections to an internal MIME subtree.
The internal subtree is known as the "protected part" though of course it may itself be a multipart object.

For PGP/MIME {{RFC3156}} there are two forms of Cryptographic Layers, signing and encryption.

In the diagrams below, <u>↧</u> is used to indicate "decrypts to".

### PGP/MIME Signing Cryptographic Layer (multipart/signed) {#multipart-signed}

    └┬╴multipart/signed
     ├─╴[protected part]
     └─╴application/pgp-signature

### PGP/MIME Encryption Cryptographic Layer (multipart/encrypted) {#multipart-encrypted}

    └┬╴multipart/encrypted
     ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
     └─╴application/octet-stream
      ↧ (decrypts to)
      └─╴[protected part]

Cryptographic Envelope
----------------------

The Cryptographic Envelope is the largest contiguous set of Cryptographic Layers of an e-mail message starting with the outermost MIME type (that is, with the Content-Type of the message itself).

If the Content-Type of the message itself is not a Cryptographic Layer, then the message has no cryptographic envelope.

"Contiguous" in the definition above indicates that if a Cryptographic Layer is the protected part of another Cryptographic Layer, the layers together comprise a single Cryptographic Envelope.

Note that if a non-Cryptographic Layer intervenes, the inner-most Cryptographic Layer *is not* part of the Cryptographic Envelope (see the example in {{baroque-example}}).

Note also that the ordering of the Cryptographic Layers implies different cryptographic properties.
A signed-then-encrypted message is different than an encrypted-then-signed message.

Cryptographic Payload
---------------------

The Cryptographic Payload of a message is the first non-Cryptographic Layer -- the "protected part" -- within the Cryptographic Envelope.
Since the Cryptographic Payload itself is a MIME part, it has its own set of headers.

Protected headers are placed on (and read from) the Cryptographic Payload, and should be considered to have the same cryptographic properties as the message itself.

### Simple Cryptographic Payloads {#simple-cryptographic-payloads}

As described above, if the "protected part" identified in {{multipart-signed}} or {{multipart-encrypted}} is not itself a Cryptographic Layer, that part *is* the Cryptographic Payload.

If the application wants to generate a message that is both encrypted and signed, it MAY use the simple MIME structure from {{multipart-encrypted}} by ensuring that the {{RFC4880}} Encrypted Message within the `application/octet-stream` part contains an {{RFC4880}} Signed Message.

### Multilayer Cryptographic Envelopes {#multilayer-cryptographic-envelopes}

It is possible to construct a Cryptographic Envelope consisting of multiple layers for PGP/MIME, typically of the following structure:

    A └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    B  ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    C  └─╴application/octet-stream
    D   ↧ (decrypts to)
    E   └┬╴multipart/signed
    F    ├─╴[Cryptographic Payload]
    G    └─╴application/pgp-signature

When handling such a message, the properties of the Cryptographic Envelope are derived from the series A, E.

As noted in {#simple-cryptographic-payloads}, PGP/MIME applications also have a simpler MIME construction available.

### A Baroque Example {#baroque-example}

Consider a message with the following overcomplicated structure:

    H └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    I  ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    J  └─╴application/octet-stream
    K   ↧ (decrypts to)
    L   └┬╴multipart/signed
    M    ├┬╴multipart/mixed
    N    │├┬╴multipart/signed
    O    ││├─╴text/plain
    P    ││└─╴application/pgp-signature
    Q    │└─╴text/plain
    R    └─╴application/pgp-signature

The 3 Cryptographic Layers in such a message are rooted in parts H, L, and N.
The Cryptographic Envelope of the message consists of the properties derived from the series H, L.
The Cryptographic Payload of the message is part M.

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to generate messages with such complicated structures.
Even if a receiving MUA can parse this structure properly, it is nearly impossible to render in a way that the user can reason about the cryptographic properties of part O.


Original Headers are Outside
----------------------------

The Cryptographic Envelope fully encloses the Cryptographic Payload, whether the message is signed or encrypted or both.
The Original Headers are considered to be outside of both.


Message Composition
===================

The Protected Headers scheme is summarized as follows:

   1. All message headers known to the MUA at composition time MUST be copied verbatim into the first MIME header of the Cryptographic Payload.
   2. When encrypting, Exposed Headers MAY be *obscured* by a transformation (including deletion).
   3. When encrypting, if the MUA has obscured any user-facing header data, it SHOULD add a Legacy Display Part to the Cryptographic Payload which duplicates this information.

*Note:* The above is not a description of a sequential algorithm.

Details:

   * Encryption SHOULD protect the Subject line
   * When encrypting, the Subject line should be obscured (replaced) by the string "..."
   * Step 3. may require adding a `multipart/mixed` MIME wrapper to the Cryptographic Payload, in turn influencing where to inject the headers from step 1.

See below for a more detailed discussion.


Header Copying
--------------

All headers known to the MUA at composition time MUST be copied verbatim into the header of the target MIME part.

The target MIME part shall always be the first MIME part within the Cryptographic Payload. See Examples below for an illustration.

The reason all headers must be copied, is that otherwise it becomes impossible for implementations to reliably detect tampering with the Exposed Headers, which would greatly reduces the strength of the scheme.

Encrypted Subject {#encrypted-subject}
-----------------

When a message is encrypted, the Subject should be obscured by replacing the Exposed Subject with three periods: ...

This value (...) was chosen because it is believed to be language agnostic and avoids communicating any potentially misleading information to the recipient (see Common Pitfalls below for a more detailed discussion).

Obscured Headers
----------------

Due to compatibility and usability concerns, a Mail User Agent SHOULD NOT obscure any of: `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Message-ID`, `References`, `Reply-To`, (FIXME: MORE?), unless the user has indicated they have security constraints which justify the potential downsides (see Common Pitfalls below for a more detailed discussion).

Aside from that limitation, this specification does not at this time define or limit the methods a MUA may use to convert Exposed Headers into Obscured Headers.

Legacy Display {#legacy-display}
--------------


Message Interpretation
======================

(Brief discussion about potential strategies to reverse the process above.)


Examples
========

(Use diagrams from Juga to explain the envelope/payload concept)

(Add sample messages using this syntax, where E or S tell us which bits are part of the Cryptographic Payload.)

    . From: Alice Lovelace <alice@example.org>
    . To: Bob Babbage <bob@example.org>
    . Subject: ...
    . Content-Type: multipart/encrypted; protocol=...; boundary=1234
    .
    . --1234
    . Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted
    .
    . Version: 1
    .
    . --1234
    . Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="encrypted.asc"
    .
    E Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=ABCD
    E (copied headers)
    E
    E --ABCD
    E (Legacy display part)
    E
    E --ABCD
    E (original message)
    E --ABCD--
    . --1234--

Text in `[` and `]` is not part of the message or not as it is, it's a clarification in the examples.
Message-ID and boundary strings have been replaced by `message_id` and `multipart_X_boundary` to make the examples more clear.
Extra new lines have been added to also make the examples more clear.

TODO: Note what we call Cryptographic Envelope in the examples.
FIXME: Enigmail adds `; protected-headers="v1"` to `multipart/mixed`. Is that needed?

Mailinglist mungles From field
------------------------------

(describe the issue, that some mailinglist softwares mungles the From line in order to make sure, that replys go to the list and not to the author. Protected headers break this workaround. See https://cr.yp.to/proto/replyto.html how this should be fixed properly in a MUA)

Comparison with Other Header Protection Schemes
===============================================

Other header protection schemes have been proposed (in the IETF and elsewhere) that are distinct from this mechanism.
This section documents the differences between those earlier mechanisms and this one, and hypothesizes why it has seen greater interoperable adoption.

The distinctions include:

 * backward compatibility with legacy clients
 * compatibility across PGP/MIME and S/MIME
 * protection for both confidentiality and signing

S/MIME 3.1 Header Protection {#smime-31}
----------------------------

S/MIME 3.1 ({{RFC3851}}) introduces header protection via `message/rfc822` header parts.

The problem with this mechanism is that many legacy clients encountering such a message were likely to interpret it as either a forwarded message, or as an unreadable substructure.

For signed messages, this is particularly jarring -- a message that was previously easily readable by a client that knows nothing about signed messages suddenly shows up as a message-within-a-message, just by virtue of signing.  This has an impact on *all* clients, whether they are cryptographically-capable or not.

For encrypted messages, whose interpretation only matters on the smaller set of cryptographically-capable legacy clients, the resulting message rendering is awkward at best.

Furthermore, Formulating a reply to such a message on a legacy client can also leave the user with weirdly-structured quoted and attributed content.

Additionally, a message deliberately forwarded in its own right (without preamble or adjacent explanatory notes) could potentially be confused with a message using the declared structure.

The mechanism described here allows cryptographically-incapable legacy MUAs to read and handle cleartext signed messages without any modifications, and permits cryptographically-capable legacy MUAs to handle encrypted messages without any modifications.

In particular, the Legacy Display part described in {#legacy-display} makes makes it feasible for a conformant MUA to generate messages with obscured Subject lines that nonetheless give access to the obscured Subject header for recipients with legacy MUAs.

The Content-Type property "forwarded=no" {forwarded=no}
----------------------------------------

{{I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-header-protection-requirements-00}} contains a proposal that attempts to mitigate one of the drawbacks of the scheme described in S/MIME 3.1 ({{smime-31}}).

In particular, it allows *non-legacy* clients to distinguish between deliberately forwarded messages and those intended to use the defined structure for header protection.

However, this fix has no impact on the confusion experienced by legacy clients.

pEp Header protection
---------------------

{{I-D.draft-luck-lamps-pep-header-protection-03}} is applicable only to signed+encrypted mail, and does not contemplate protection of signed-only mail.

In addition, the pEp header protection involved for "pEp message format 2" has an additional `multipart/mixed`  layer designed to facilitate transfer of OpenPGP Transferable Public Keys, which seems orthogonal to the effort to protect headers.

Finally, that draft suggests that the exposed Subject header be one of "=?utf-8?Q?p=E2=89=A1p?=", "pEp", or "Encrypted message".
"pEp" is a mysterious choice for most users, and see {{misunderstood-obscured-subjects}} for more commentary on why "Encrypted message" is likely to be problematic.

DKIM
----

{{RFC6736}} offers DKIM, which is often used to sign headers associated with a message.

DKIM is orthogonal to the work described in this document, since it is typically done by the domain operator and not the end user generating the original message.
That is, DKIM is not "end-to-end" and does not represent the intent of the entity generating the message.

Furthermore, a DKIM signer does not have access to headers inside an encrypted Cryptographic Layer, and a DKIM verifier cannot effectively use DKIM to verify such confidential headers.

S/MIME "Secure Headers"
-----------------------

{{RFC7508}} describes a mechanism that embeds message header fields in the S/MIME signature using ASN.1.

The mechanism proposed in that draft is undefined for use with PGP/MIME.
While all S/MIME clients must be able to handle CMS and ASN.1 as well as MIME, a standard that works at the MIME layer itself should be applicable to any MUA that can work with MIME, regardess of whether end-to-end security layers are provided by S/MIME or PGP/MIME.

That mechanism also does not propose a means to provide confidentiality protection for headers within an encrypted-but-not-signed message.

Finally, that mechanism offers no equivalent to the Legacy Display described in {{legacy-display}}.
Instead, sender and receiver are expected to negotiate in some unspecified way to ensure that it is safe to remove or modify Exposed Headers in an encrypted message.

Triple-wrapping
---------------

{{RFC2634}} defines "Triple Wrapping" as a means of providing cleartext signatures over signed and encrypted material.
While this can be used in combination with the mechanism described in {{RFC7508}} to authenticate some headers for transport using S/MIME.

But it does not offer confidentiality protection for the protected headers, and the signer of the outer layer of a triple-wrapped message may not be the originator of the message either.

In practice on today's Internet, DKIM ({{RFC6736}} provides a more widely-accepted cryptographic header-verification-for-transport mechanism  than triple-wrapped messages.


IANA Considerations
===================

FIXME: register flag for legacy-display part

Security Considerations
=======================

This document describes a technique that can be used to defend against two security vulnerabilities in traditional end-to-end encrypted e-mail.

Subject Leak
------------

While e-mail structure considers the Subject header to be part of the message metadata, nearly all users consider the Subject header to be part of the message content.

As such, a user sending end-to-end encrypted e-mail may inadvertently leak sensitive material in the Subject line.

If the user's MUA uses Protected Headers and obscures the Subject header as described in {{encrypted-subject}} then they can avoid this breach of confidentiality.

Signature Replay
----------------

Messages without Protected Headers may be subject to a signature replay attack.
Such an attack works by taking a message delivered in one context (e.g., to someone else, at a different time, with a different subject, in reply to a different message), and replaying it with different message headers.

A MUA that generates all its signed messages with Protected Headers gives recipients the opportunity to avoid falling victim to this attack.

Guidance for how a message recipient can use Protected Headers to defend against a signature replay attack are out of scope for this document.

Privacy Considerations
======================

This document only explicitly contemplates confidentiality protection for the Subject header, but not for other headers which may leak associational metadata.
For example, `From` and `To` and `Cc` and `Reply-To` and `Date` and `Message-Id` and `References` and `In-Reply-To` are not explicitly necessary for messages in transit, since the SMTP envelope carries all necessary routing information, but an encrypted {{RFC2822}} message as described in this document will contain all this associational metadata in the clear.

Although this document does not provide guidance for protecting the privacy of this metadata directly, it offers a platform upon which thoughtful implementations may experiment with obscuring additional e-mail headers.

These ideas were tested and fine-tuned in part by the loose collaboration of MUA developers known as Autocrypt.

Additional feedback and useful guidance was contributed by attendees of the OpenPGP e-mail summit ({{OpenPGP-Email-Summit-2019}}).

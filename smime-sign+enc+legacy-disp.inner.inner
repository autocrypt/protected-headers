Hi Bob!

I just signed the contract with BarCorp and they've set us up with
an account on their system for testing.

The account information is:

        Site: https://barcorp.example/
    Username: examplecorptest
    Password: correct-horse-battery-staple

Please get the account set up and apply the test harness.

Let me know when you've got some results.

Thanks, Alice
